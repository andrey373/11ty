##### Hi, I am Ish∆n.

I am a product designer and a Frontend developer. I am glad you have reached here to see my website.

###### My creative journey started at Oslo where I studied for the past years. I’ve been able to work with talented people, especially across the Europe (some cities). Firstly, I joined Sloopy at Norway. Then, I worked with the team of iron-clad in Amsterdam.
